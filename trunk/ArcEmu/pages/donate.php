There are various expenses for the day to day running of this server. We try to provide to you an optimal gaming performance experience, but this doesnt come cheapely, which is why we are now asking for donations to help cover some of the costs. We are currently paying for this server out of our own personal money, so any donations given will help subsidise the expenses incurred greatly.<br><br>
Please understand that we are not a profit driven server, these donations are mainly here to help keep our out of pocket expenses to a minimum, and our server online.<br><br>
If donations go above the costs incurred, this gives us an even greater capacity to improve the server hardware setup to increase server performance and capacity. So helping us ends up helping you as well.<br><br>
Donations are made only via <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a>, we do not accept any other forms of payment. If you havent got <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> setup, we recommend visiting the <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> and registering an account. As long as you have a valid Credit Card or Bank Account, you can link those to <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a>. Be aware that paying by Credit Card does not require a <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> account, so registering with <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> is not compulsory.<br><br>
<a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> is a secure online payment system, it has become quite popular and is preferred by many users as a safe and easy way to conduct monetary transactions over the internet.<br><br>
Please note, be aware that donations are a gift, giving rewards are merely given so people who donate get given something by us to say thankyou. Donations are not a contract of sale and we do not give refunds.
