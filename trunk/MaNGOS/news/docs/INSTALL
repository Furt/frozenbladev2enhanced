INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================
(For a more friendly approach on installing, see /docs/HOWTO)
	REQUIREMENTS
		_PHP 5 or later (htmlspecialchars)
		_mySQL
		File uploading
		PERL REGEX FUNCTIONS
		SIMPLEXML
		

1. Extract all files from the .tar.gz (or other filetype) (or skip this if you downloaded via SVN) to a directory of your choice.

2. Visit the directory in your web browser (Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc etc) [We do not recommend IE6 or 7!]

3. You will be redirected to the /install/ directory.

4. Follow the onscreen instructions.
	NOTICE: If you are upgrading from v1, DO NOT CHECK THE "upgrade from v1.*" CHECKBOX. YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THIS *AFTER* THE INSTALLATION OF v2.
	
5. Once you are presented with the last page, it will tell you one of two possibilities.
	a. Complete success, and phpns wrote to the config.php file, or
	b. We don't have write access to config.php, so you need to paste the information yourself.
		xx. Open config.php on your server/machine, and paste the code you were presented with in the last step. Save and upload.

6. Installation finished, visit the root of the phpns directory.

7. You will be reminded to DELETE THE /INSTALL/ DIRECTORY, because it has no further use. IT IS A SECURITY RISK TO LEAVE THIS FOLDER UNDELETED.
	NOTICE: If you wish to upgrade from a previous  version, skip this step and continue to UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS.
	

UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

To upgrade from the previous version, follow the instructions on http://phpns.com. Usually, you will download a .zip or tarball, extract it into the root of your phpns installation (overwriting any files), and run, if present, the upgrade_from_2.x.x.php file.*
	* To run scripts, just upload them and run them in your web browser.
